# Task5

## Pairplot:

- Survivors tend to have different distributions in Age, Fare, and Pclass.
- Younger passengers and passengers who paid higher fares seem more likely to survive.

## Heatmap:

- Fare has a positive correlation with Survived.
- Pclass has a negative correlation with Survived (lower class = lower survival chance).
- Age shows a weak negative correlation with Survived.

## Histograms:

- Most passengers are young adults (~20-30 years).
- Most paid a relatively low fare; a few paid very high fares.
- Majority of passengers are in 3rd class.

## Boxplots:

- Survivors generally have higher median fares compared to non-survivors.
- Survivors' age distribution shows more younger people surviving.

## Scatterplots:

- Higher fare and lower age groups seem to have better survival rates.
- There's clustering of survivors in the younger and richer sections.
